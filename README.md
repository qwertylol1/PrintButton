Print Button for Webpages
During my internship, I developed a versatile print button that enhances webpage functionality. This HTML button, combined with JavaScript, allows users to extract specific sections of a webpage easily. It provides the option to print the content directly or download it, with or without images.

Key Features:
Extracts Webpage Sections: Selectively print or download only the content you need.
Flexible Printing Options: Choose to include images or print text-only for a cleaner output.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple integration into existing web projects, making it accessible for all users.
This tool is designed to streamline the printing process, improving usability and enhancing user experience on your website.

Feel free to modify any part to better fit your style!
